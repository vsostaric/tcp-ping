= TCP Ping

== Description
This is small app which tests the tcp (Transmission Control Protocol) connection speed.
The application can run as a pitcher or a catcher.
Both require a port and host, while the pitcher also requires the size of messages.
Once started the pitcher sends messages of the defined size to the catcher and the catcher returns a response.
The pitcher measures the response speed and the number of messages returned.
